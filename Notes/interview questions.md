### Why react js is called a library where as React Native is called a framework ?

```
React.js is called a library because it primarily handles the view layer, providing a declarative syntax for UI components. React Native is termed a framework because it offers a more comprehensive solution for mobile app development, providing tools, pre-built components, and access to device features. The distinction lies in their respective scopes and levels of abstraction.

React.js is designed for web applications and renders components in the browser using the DOM (Document Object Model), while React Native is designed for mobile app development and renders components using native UI elements on iOS and Android platforms. React Native also allows for platform-specific code adjustments when needed.
